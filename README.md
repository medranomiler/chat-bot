# chat-bot
This is a chat bot that uses the Open AI gpt-3.5-turbo model, better known as the model for ChatGPT. This is a single page application and requires you enter your own api key to function. It may be useful for times when ChatGPT is having server errors. This does not log previous questions and answers but you are free to add that feature if you want it.
